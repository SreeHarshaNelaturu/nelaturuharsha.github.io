- title: "Fair + EfficiencyFederated Learning"
  description: Gradient based learning leveraging sparsity is desirable in and has found success in centralized paradigms as well as in federated learning.
               A key challenge beyond the communication bottleneck in FL is device fairness, in algorithms like FedAvg [esp in non-IID settings] there is significant variance in performance.
                Our projects aims to leverage sparsity to address this.
