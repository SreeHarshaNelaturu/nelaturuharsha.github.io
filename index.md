## About Me

I am currently a Graduate Student at Universitate Des Saarlandes studying *data and compute efficient deep learning in computer vision*. I am also interested in working on projects involving and at the intersection of learning theory, computational creativity, distributed systems, numerical linear algebra and optimization. Climate science, sustainability and access are the core tenets that drive my research interests.

During my B.Tech in ECE at SRMIST, Chennai I led and was part of Next Tech Lab, an interdisciplinary student-led research group and founded the SRM Machine Intelligence Community. I was a special student in EECS at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I was an undergrad researcher at the Responsive Environments group, MIT Media Lab advised by Ishwarya Ananthabhotla and Prof Joseph Paradiso.

Projects I have worked on for companies like RunwayML, Myelin Foundry and Rediscovery.io have involved projects on applications of deep learning to generate, enhance and process media content included but not limited to images, video and audio.

I look forward to chatting and potentially collaborating, please feel free to reach out to me via email or any other social channel.
